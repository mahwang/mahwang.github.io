      <h1 class="title">Study Abroad? Czech!</h1>

        Having the opportunity to study abroad was the best thing I have ever experienced. Sounds cliche, I know. 
        But if you get the chance to experience it all --  a semester, a year, or even a couple of weeks -- you would completely understand. 
        It’s so hard to put into words, the feelings, food, culture, fashion, but hopefully I can convince you enough to consider the opportunity of a lifetime. 
      </p> 

      <p> 
        As an international ambassador for my college of business, I tend to hear many parents having a misconception about what studying abroad really means. 
      </p>
        
      <p>“It’s just one long vacation.” “Is it even worth the money?” “I want my kid to focus on school.” “It’s too expensive.” </p>
        
      <p>
        Depending on what program you choose, the latter can be true, but, there are many ways to cut costs and save money. 
        Reach out to your global education office and you will discover that there are many scholarships or financial aid students can apply for. 
        I did a program in accordance with my university and the coordinator of my program and the European office always provided us with support and answers for any questions/concerns we had to make it easier. 
        When I came back from Prague, some family friends joked around whether or not I learned anything academically or just relaxed an entire semester.

        A lot of people forget - college isn’t just about an academic experience. 
        It teaches individuals how to become independent, what their interests are, how to be confident, what other cultures, sports, languages are like, and so much more. 
        Studying abroad is no different. It gives you the opportunity for personal and professional growth. I like to think that study abroad can be better than a normal college semester. 
        Academically, not only do you learn to adjust to different teaching styles and curriculum, but it’s also synonymous to learning out of a real-life textbook. Everywhere you go, the culture is RICH. 
        Visiting museums, historical sites such as Auschitwz or Wieliczka Salt Mines, churches, meeting locals; there is so much tradition and life within each culture we don’t even realize until we explore ourselves. 
      </p>
        Living in a different country has taught me so much. 
        Gaining that piece of independence and courage when navigating through a whole new city with a new language that is so hard and different from other languages (still to this day, I only know a few words oops) is empowering. 
        Not just from traveling and adjusting to the European lifestyle, but also from learning the different teaching styles in university and my internship. 
        The amount of times I’ve ran into problems could go on forever: getting lost, tricked into paying more, overcoming language and culture differences, missed busses, delayed flights, etc. 
        My point is, life is such a learning process, but the opportunities we get presented with always opens new and more exciting doors we never knew existed. The only way to learn something is to do it. 
        If you don’t, you’ll never realize your potential. Obviously, if you don’t have the luxury of traveling abroad, do it in your hometown! Try something new: a new routine, a new side hobby, a new adventure, you’ll never know change until you try it out!
