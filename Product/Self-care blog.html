        <h1 class="title">What is self-care?</h1>
        <p>July 27, 2020</p>

        <p>
        The World Health Organization, also known as WHO, defines the term self-care as, 
        “the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, 
        maintain health, and to cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a 
        healthcare provider”. Self-care is such a broad concept that encompasses all aspects of an 
        individual’s lifestyle to the greater good of the community. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Over the last few years, it seemed as if society deemed self-care as a ‘trend’, if you will. 
        In the perspective of a college student, it feels very female-focused and defined as face masks, 
        manicure/pedicures, retail therapy, or having a girls night in. Don’t get me wrong, all the things 
        listed above can be routines of self-care, but it is so much more. And not just for women: men, transgenders, 
        and nonbinary included as well. Every person on this planet needs their daily dose of care and it comes in many shapes, sizes, and forms. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Self-care is the ability to maintain a healthy relationship with yourself. It’s the practice of recognizing what’s good and what’s toxic, 
        what you can handle, and what you can’t. It’s stopping to smell the roses and learning to be present in the moment. Life gets busy and sometimes messy; 
        you get thrown into overwhelming situations. Many people practice some form of self-care without realizing, but I believe it’s equally as important to 
        acknowledge what you’re doing for yourself. It’s almost selfish to not act on your mental and physical health in these moments. 
        Remember, it takes sun and rain for a flower to grow.
        </p>

        <p>
        You might be wondering, what is considered self-care? What can I do for myself? The answer? It’s up to you. YOU are the creator of your own life, 
        YOU are the one who knows what’s best for yourself, therefore, YOU need to decide what works and what doesn’t. Have you ever slowed down to think why you 
        do certain things? Why do you go to the gym? Why do you participate in certain diets? Why do you buy certain items? Is it because you actually want to?
        Or are you trying to fit into society’s standards or trends? 
        </p>

        <p>
        Take the time to backtrack on your practices and make sure it’s truly for yourself and something positive results from it. If you are having negative thoughts 
        towards your body, think about what it has done for you and what it can do for you. If you’re stressed out from work or an activity, take a break. Don’t burn out. 
        Turn off that computer, get off social media, do some yoga, go for a walk, practice journaling, drink some tea, exercise, listen to music. Express gratitude towards yourself, please! 
        </p>

        <p>
        I’m not here to tell you how to live your life, but I’m asking you to be aware of what you put into your body and the measures you go to take care of yourself. At the end of the day, 
        where you are in your life is the reflection of the choices you are making today. You have to give yourself the permission to invest in your mental and physical well-being to grow. 
        Prioritizing self-care is NOT a selfish act. It’s hard to be happy and healthy when everything seems so out of place. Do what it takes to be the best version of you. Make the effort.
        </p>
