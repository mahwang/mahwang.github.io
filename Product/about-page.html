            <p>
                Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Maggie and I am extremely passionate about self-care.
                Over the past years, I've learned so much about myself: what my body can do for me, what I can handle, 
                and who I am becoming as a person. When I take time to self reflect and focus on the present, I am able 
                to gradually change my habits mentally and physically and become the best version of myself. 
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey of self love started when I began working out at the gym in highschool. It boosted
                my confidence levels, made me feel stronger, and allowed me to build relationships within the fitness community. Something
                I love about self-care is that it costs NOTHING. It is NOT expensive to change your habits into something positive. 
                It is so incredibly important to recognize what you love about yourself and ways you can work towards your goals. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>A little about me: </strong>
                <br/>
                I am a lover of chai tea lattes and oat milk, brunch, Trader Joe's, pinteresting, shopping, and traveling (35 countries
                and counting)! Weightlifting makes me happy and I admire the quote, "stop and smell the roses." I love people who ask me 
                how I'm doing or how my day has been. Light yellow is my favorite color because it's so cheerful and reminds me of the sun. 
                My favorite season is fall because anything pumpkin related is amazing. I love a good DIY project (scrapbooks, thrifting, canvas painting).
                Fashion and styling clothing/accessories is something I enjoy and a lot of my inspiration comes from traveling. 
            </p>
